<p>
  Have a look at the <a href="../Foundation/Summit/2024/program.html">program</a> of the <a
    href="../Foundation/Summit/2024">seL4 Summit 2024</a>.
  We have a great line-up of interesting seL4 work, with a combination of
  technical research and development, experience reports of seL4 in the field,
  technical discussions and birds-of-a-feather sessions.
