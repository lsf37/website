  Foundation's mission to continue advancing the ecosystem, the code
  base, and the verification efforts of seL4, the world's most
  advanced and highly assured operating-system kernel.

  self-driving cars using seL4, aiming to make the first formally
  proven safety-critical system on the road into a reality for
  millions of drivers.
