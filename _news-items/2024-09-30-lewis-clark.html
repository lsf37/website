    Lewis &amp; Clark is a private, liberal arts college located in the Pacific
    Northwest of the United States. In our mathematical sciences department, we
    are pursuing the goal of making single-function connected devices more
    secure. Towards this end, we are proving a minimal, pure IPv6 networking
    stack implementation correct. We rely on seL4's infrastructure (i.e.,
    microkernel, Microkit, and device driver framework) as well as seL4's
    methodologies (e.g., proofs verified by Isabelle/HOL).
