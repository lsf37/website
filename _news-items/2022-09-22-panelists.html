    We are very fortunate to welcome four leaders at major funding agencies to participate in a session <a
      href="../Foundation/Summit/2022/abstracts2022.html#a-Funding-agencies"><strong>Funding agencies: priorities and
        vision</strong></a> at the <a href="../Foundation/Summit/2022/">seL4 Summit</a>. They will each give their views
    on the priorities and vision of their agency in terms of high-assurance systems.
