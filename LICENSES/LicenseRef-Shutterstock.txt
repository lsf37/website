Please revisit this TOS when you purchase any Content licenses. Shutterstock reserves the right to modify the TOS at any time in its sole discretion. Prior to such changes becoming effective, Shutterstock will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such change. Such notice may be made by email to the email address on file in your Shutterstock account, an announcement on this page, your login page, and/or by other means.

in a multi-media production displayed or distributed via the web, on social media, using so-called "Apps", or as otherwise disseminated in accordance herewith (see restrictions for distribution limitations), provided the audience for such production does not exceed 500,000, it being understood that the use of Video in a multi-media production distributed via broadcast, cable network, OTT video service, or in theaters is expressly prohibited under this license, irrespective of audience size;

A VIDEO COMP LICENSE grants you the right to use watermarked, low resolution Video as a comp (the "Comp Video") solely in test, sample, comp, or rough cut evaluation materials. Video Comp Licenses do not permit you to display or distribute to the public or incorporate into any final materials any such Video. Comp Video can be edited, but you may not remove or alter the Shutterstock watermark. Comp Video is available to license under the Video Use License at the time it is downloaded as Comp Video, but Shutterstock makes no guarantees and shall have no obligation to ensure that Comp Video will be available for license at any time thereafter.

EDITORIAL LICENSE

AN EDITORIAL LICENSE grants you the right to make a single, editorial use of an item of Editorial content, which single use may be distributed worldwide, in perpetuity.

A "single use" for the purposes of this license permits the use of Editorial content in a single context (i.e., a news story, blog post, page of a publication) a single time, provided you shall have the right to distribute that use in-context across unlimited mediums and distribution channels. For example, the use of Editorial content to illustrate a printed article, maybe reused on a blog, on social media, etc., provided it is in-context to the original printed article. Any use not in-context to the original printed article would require an additional license.

An "editorial use" for the purposes of this license shall be a use made for descriptive purposes in a context that is newsworthy or of human interest and expressly excludes commercial uses such as advertising or merchandising.

Any use of Editorial Content licensed hereunder is further subject to those express restrictions set forth in Part I, Section 4 (prohibiting any use distributed via broadcast/cable/OTT, on publication covers, and in print runs in excess of 500,000) as well as any “special restrictions” (e.g., geographical or industry-specific usage restrictions) indicated on the image detail page and/or included in the metadata attached to an item of Editorial Content.

All Editorial content shall be deemed "Editorial Use Only" for the purposes of this TOS.

Not all Editorial content is available for license from the Shutterstock website, nor may it be available from all subscriptions. You understand that the Editorial content available for license can change at any time and you shall have no right to demand to license any particular item of Editorial content. If you want to license any Editorial content not available for license from the website, please contact Customer Service. (Phone: Inside US 1-866-663-3954, Outside US 1-646-419-4452 Email: Customer Support)

Use Visual Content designated "Editorial Use Only" (including, but not limited to, Editorial content) for commercial purposes, including for reference, in any advertising, merchandise or other non-editorial contexts.

Resell, redistribute, provide access to, share or transfer any Visual Content except as specifically provided herein. For example and not by way of limitation, the foregoing prohibits displaying Content as, or as part of, a "gallery" of content through which third parties may search and select from such content.

Use Visual Content in a manner that infringes upon any third party's trademark or other intellectual property, or would give rise to a claim of deceptive advertising or unfair competition.

Use any Visual Content as training data for any artificial intelligence, machine learning, or generative AI system, tool, process, or dataset. This does not prohibit using AI features of software to edit or publish Customer Works incorporating Visual Content, provided that such software does not train on the Visual Content or Customer Work.

RESTRICTIONS SPECIFIC TO VIDEO

YOU MAY NOT:

Use "stills" derived from Video except solely in connection with the in-context marketing, promotion, and advertising of your derivative works incorporating Video.

A "single use" for the purposes of this license permits the use of Content in a single context (i.e., a news story, blog post, page of a publication) a single time, provided you shall have the right to distribute that use in-context across unlimited mediums and distribution channels. Because of this single use limitation, each additional use of that Content requires an additional license, so for each use of Content, you must re-download that Content for each such use.

Download or Use any Content in any way contrary to the terms of the Fair Usage Policy.

CREDIT AND COPYRIGHT NOTICES

Use the Licensed Music in connection with other material that is pornographic, defamatory, libelous, obscene, immoral, illegal or that otherwise violates any right(s) of any third party(ies);

Use any Licensed Music as training data for any artificial intelligence, machine learning, or generative AI system, tool, process, or dataset.

RESTRICTIONS SPECIFIC TO UNLIMITED SUBSCRIPTION LICENSED MUSIC

Make any new use of Music after the expiration of your subscription.

Use any Music downloaded under an Unlimited plan for any second use. Each item of Content downloaded under an Unlimited plan may be used for a single use per download, which single use may be distributed worldwide, in perpetuity. A "single use" for the purposes of this license permits the use of Content in a single context (i.e., a news story, blog post, page of a publication) a single time, provided you shall have the right to distribute that use in-context across unlimited mediums and distribution channels. Because of this single use limitation, each additional use of that Content requires an additional license, so for each use of Content, you must re-download that Content for each such use.

Download or Use any Content in any way contrary to the terms of the Fair Usage Policy.

Except for the PRO-free Music in the event any public performance licenses are required in connection with your use of the Licensed Music as authorized under this TOS, you shall be responsible for obtaining such licenses at your sole expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this TOS: (a) in the event the laws of any jurisdiction require that, in order to avoid infringement or the violation of any third party rights, licenses be obtained from collection societies or similar entities for or in connection with activities otherwise authorized under this TOS, you shall be responsible for obtaining and paying for such licenses at your sole expense; and (b) this agreement does not include any so-called "moral rights" or like rights.

This obligation shall apply to all Licensed Music other than the PRO-free Music.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, and in respect of the PRO-free Music, you acknowledge and agree that nothing herein shall preclude Shutterstock from making a claim for a share of any so-called “black box” funds or any funds paid, or payable, by any collection society or otherwise by way of general distribution on a country by country basis. In addition, in the event that any PRO-free Music is publicly performed (or made available for performance) by any entity engaged in the exhibition or other transmission of programming (each a “Downstream Distributor”), and such exhibition gives rise to the payment by such Downstream Distributor of fees or royalties to a performing rights organization in any jurisdiction, nothing herein shall be preclude Shutterstock from making a claim for a share of such monies, it being acknowledged that where a Downstream Distributor is not licensed for the performance of Music through licenses with performing rights organizations, then the use of the PRO-free Music as incorporated into a Production distributed, exhibited, and/or transmitted by such *Downstream Distributor shall be deemed to be direct and there shall be no obligation (created herein) upon such Downstream Distributor to obtain any license from any performing rights organization in respect of such use.

You may publish Productions incorporating Music on third party "user-generated" content distribution platforms (e.g., YouTube) (each a "UGC Platform").

If you become aware that any third party claims any ownership interests in any Music, you agree to promptly notify Shutterstock of each such claim.

When incorporating the Music in the type of Production in which copyright attribution is customary, you shall provide credit in substantially the following form:

"'[Music Title]' performed by [Artist], used under license from Shutterstock"

While Shutterstock makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of keywords and descriptions, as well as the integrity of Visual Content designated "Editorial Use Only", SHUTTERSTOCK MAKES NO WARRANTIES AND/OR REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING ANY: I) KEYWORD, TITLES OR DESCRIPTIONS; OR II) AUDIO IN VIDEO. For the sake of clarity, Shutterstock will not indemnify or have any liability in respect of any claims arising from inaccurate keyword, titles or descriptions, any audio in Video.

SHUTTERSTOCK MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY MADE IN THIS "WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS" SECTION.

PART IV - INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY

You will indemnify and hold Shutterstock, its officers, employees, shareholders, directors, managers, members and suppliers, harmless against any damages or liability of any kind arising from any use of the Visual Content other than the uses expressly permitted by this TOS. You further agree to indemnify Shutterstock for all costs and expenses that Shutterstock incurs in the event that you breach any of the terms of this or any other agreement with Shutterstock.

PART V - ADDITIONAL TERMS

Except when required by law, Shutterstock shall be under no obligation to issue refunds under any circumstances. All fees are non-refundable, even if your subscription is terminated before its expiration. If you cancel before the end of the 12 month term, you will be charged 50% of your remaining contract obligation, unless local law requires otherwise. You will retain your subscription for the amount of months paid for with your cancellation fee for your annual subscription. You authorize Shutterstock to charge you all subscription fees for the duration of the term agreed to at the time of purchase. In the event that Shutterstock determines that you are entitled to a refund of all or part of the fees you paid, such refund shall be made using the payment method originally used by you to make your purchase. If you reside in the European Union and you cancel your account within fourteen (14) days of making payment to Shutterstock, provided that you have not yet downloaded or licensed any Visual Content, Shutterstock, will refund the payment made by you in connection with such cancelled account. To cancel your account, please contact Customer Service. (Phone: Inside US 1-866-663-3954, Outside US 1-646-419-4452 Email: Customer Support).

Following the expiration of your subscription plan, such plan will automatically renew on the same terms as your original plan purchase. You can disable automatic renewal at any time prior to renewal using your account settings. You expressly grant Shutterstock the right to charge you for each automatic renewal until you timely disable automatic renewal.

The fees charged by Shutterstock are exclusive of taxes, and all such taxes, direct or indirect, shall be in addition to any fees related to the products you are buying. If Shutterstock is required to collect indirect and/or transactional taxes (such as sales tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, et al) under the laws of your state or country of residence, you shall be liable for payment of any such indirect tax. Where Shutterstock or you are required to collect or remit direct or indirect taxes, you may be required to self-assess said tax under the applicable laws of your country of residence.

"Non-transferable" as used herein means that except as specifically provided in this TOS, you may not sell, rent, load, give, sublicense, or otherwise transfer to anyone, Content or the right to use Content. You may however, make a one-time transfer of Content to a third party for the sole purpose of causing such third party to print and/or manufacture your goods incorporating Content subject to the terms and conditions herein. If you become aware that any social media website uses any Content in a manner that exceeds your license hereunder, you agree to remove all derivative works incorporating Content from such Social Media Site, and to promptly notify Shutterstock of each such social media website's use. You agree to take all commercially reasonable steps to prevent third parties from duplicating any Content. If you become aware of any unauthorized duplication of any Content please contact Customer Service. (Phone: Inside US 1-866-663-3954, Outside US 1-646-419-4452 Email: Customer Support).

Upon notice from Shutterstock or if you learn that any Content is subject to a threatened or actual claim of infringement, violation of another right, or any other claim for which Shutterstock may be liable, or if Shutterstock removes any Content due to perceived business risk as determined in Shutterstock's reasonable discretion and gives you notice of such removal, you will remove the Content from your computer systems and storage devices (electronic or physical) and, if possible, cease any future use of the removed Content at your own expense. Shutterstock shall provide you with comparable Content (which comparability will be determined by Shutterstock in its reasonable commercial judgment) free of charge, but subject to the terms and conditions of this TOS.

If you use any Content as part of work product created for or delivered to a client or customer, you will disclose the identities of such clients or customers to Shutterstock, upon Shutterstock’s reasonable request.

Arbitration.

Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this TOS, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by binding individual (not class) arbitration administered under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association or of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution in effect on the date of the commencement of arbitration, rather than in court, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets. The place of arbitration shall be as specified in Section 5.24. The language of the arbitration shall be English. There shall be one arbitrator to be mutually agreed by the parties. Each party shall bear its own costs in the arbitration. Both parties agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack) (iii) any claim arising solely from Customer’s alleged failure to pay fees due to Shutterstock. This arbitration provision will survive termination of this TOS.
YOU AND SHUTTERSTOCK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Shutterstock agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. You and Shutterstock acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable disputes under this TOS.
If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of the limitations in this Part V, Section 7 as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
Neither party may assign this agreement, without the prior written approval of the other party, except that Shutterstock may assign this agreement to a subsidiary, an affiliated company within the Shutterstock group, the entity that results from a merger or other corporate reorganization involving Shutterstock, or an entity that acquires all or substantially all of Shutterstock’s assets or capital stock.

This TOS shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning of the language hereof. This TOS is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the applicable jurisdiction set forth in Section 5.24, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.

If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of your employer or other entity, you warrant and represent that you have the full right and authority to do so. In the event that you do not have such authority, you agree that you will be personally liable to Shutterstock for any breaches of the terms of this TOS. You hereby grant Shutterstock a worldwide, non-exclusive, limited license to use your trademarks in Shutterstock's promotional materials, including a public customer list. Shutterstock's use of your trademarks shall at all times conform to your then-current trademark use policies as made available to Shutterstock and shall at all times inure to your benefit. Shutterstock further agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate any particular use of your trademark no later than thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by Shutterstock of your email request to legal-notices@shutterstock.com.

The number of Content downloads available to you is determined by the product you purchase. For the purposes of this TOS, a day is defined as the twenty four (24) hour period beginning at the time your product is purchased. A month is defined as a calendar month beginning on and including the date that you purchase your product and ending on that date which is the earlier of (i) the same date as your purchase in the following month or (ii) the last day of the following month. By way of example, if you purchase a monthly subscription on March 5, it will renew on April 5. If you purchase a monthly subscription on August 31, your subscription will renew on September 30.

Unless otherwise specified in the coupon, any coupon or discount code applied to a purchase hereunder shall apply only to the first payment made in connection with such purchase.

If any individual term of this TOS is found to be invalid or unenforceable by any legal or regulatory body of competent jurisdiction, such finding will be limited solely to such invalid or unenforceable part, without affecting the remaining parts of such individual term, or any other part of this TOS, so that this TOS shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

You expressly agree that any feedback provided to you by Shutterstock or its representatives regarding any questions you may have about this TOS or your use of Content licensed hereunder, is solely for the purpose of interpreting this TOS and is not legal advice. Shutterstock cannot render legal advice to you and expressly disclaims any liability of any kind related to any feedback provided by Shutterstock or its representatives.

It is expressly understood and agreed that this TOS is entered into solely for the mutual benefit of the parties herein and that no benefits, rights, duties, or obligations are intended by this TOS as to third parties.

In the event that you breach any of the terms of this or any other agreement with Shutterstock, Shutterstock shall have the right to terminate your account without further notice, in addition to Shutterstock's other rights at law and/or equity. Shutterstock shall be under no obligation to refund any fees paid by you in the event that your account is terminated by reason of a breach.

Except as expressly set forth in the applicable license and warranties sections herein, Shutterstock grants no rights and makes no further warranties. Shutterstock only has model or property releases where expressly indicated on the Shutterstock website.

Shutterstock's liability under any individual license purchased hereunder shall not exceed the "Limit of Liability" applicable to the license in effect at the time you know or should have known of the claim, and is without regard to the number of times the subject Content is licensed or used by you.

Except as specifically provided in Part IV hereof, in no event, will Shutterstock's total aggregate liability to you or any third party claiming through you, arising out of or in connection with your use of or inability to use the Shutterstock websites and/or Content contained thereon (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) exceed the monetary amount actually received by Shutterstock from you for the applicable Content license.

Neither Shutterstock nor any of its officers, employees, managers, members, shareholders, directors or suppliers shall be liable to you or to any other person or entity for any general, punitive, special, indirect, consequential or incidental damages, or lost profits or any other damages, costs or losses arising out of your use of the Content, Shutterstock's breach of this agreement, or otherwise, unless expressly provided for herein, even if Shutterstock has been advised of the possibility of such damages, costs or losses.

Except as expressly set forth in Part III, all Content is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties of non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. Some Content may contain elements that require additional clearance if the Content is modified or used in a particular context. If you make such modification or use Content in such context, you are solely responsible for obtaining any additional clearances thereby required.

Shutterstock does not warrant that the Content, Shutterstock websites, or other materials will meet your requirements or that use will be uninterrupted or error free. The entire risk as to the quality, performance and use of the Content is solely with you.

In the event that you use fraudulent credit card information to open an account or otherwise engage in any criminal activity affecting Shutterstock, Shutterstock will promptly file a complaint with www.ic3.gov, the internet crime complaint center, a partnership between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National White Collar Crime Center.
