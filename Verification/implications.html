<div class="theprose">
<p>
  The <a href="proofs.html">proof page</a> covers the properties that are proved
  directly: functional correctness, integrity, and confidentiality. These are
  high-level properties that every OS should provide, that very few manage to
  provide, and that no OS has better evidence for than seL4.
</p>
<p>
  But the seL4 proofs do more &mdash; the formal proof of functional correctness
  implies the absence of whole classes of common programming errors. Provided
  the <a href="assumptions.html">proof assumptions</a> are true, some of these
  excluded common errors are:
</p>
<ul>
  {% include green-tick-li.html
    bold="No buffer overflows:"
    text="buffer overflows are a classic security attack
    against operating systems, trying to make the software crash or to inject
    malicious code into the cycle. We have proved that no such attack can be
    successful on verified configurations of seL4."
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
    bold="No null pointer dereferences:"
    text="null pointer dereferences are another
    common issue in the C programming language. In applications they tend to
    lead to strange error messages and lost data. In operating systems they will
    usually crash the whole system. They do not occur in verified configurations
    of seL4."
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
    bold="No pointer errors:"
    text="in C it is possible to accidentally use a
    pointer to the wrong type of data. This is a common programming error. It
    does not happen in verified configurations of the seL4 kernel."
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
    bold="No memory leaks:"
    text="memory leaks occur when memory is requested, but never
    given back. The other direction is even worse: memory could be given back,
    even though it is still in use. Neither of these can happen in verified
    configurations of seL4."
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
    bold="No arithmetic overflows or exceptions:"
    text="humans and mathematics usually
    have a concept of numbers that can be arbitrarily big. Machines do not, they
    need to fit them into memory, usually into 32 or 64 bits worth of storage.
    Machines also generate exceptions when you attempt to do things that are
    mathematically undefined like dividing by zero. In the OS, such exceptions
    would typically crash the machine. This does not occur in verified
    configurations of seL4."
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
    bold="No undefined behaviour:"
    text="there are many static analysis and verification
    tools that check for the absence of undefined behaviour in C. Our proof
    explicitly checks that no such undefined behaviour occurs."
  %}
</ul>
<p>
  The list goes on. There are other techniques that can also be used to find
  some of these errors. Here, the absence of such bugs is just a useful
  by-product of the proof.
</p>
<p>
  To be able to complete our proof of functional
  correctness, we also prove a large number of so-called <strong>invariants</strong>: properties
  that we know to always be true when the kernel runs. To normal people these
  will not be exciting, but to experts and kernel programmers they give an
  immense amount of useful information. They give you the reasons why and how
  data structures work, why it is safe to optimise and leave out certain checks
  (because you know they will always be true), and why the code always
  executes in a defined and safe manner.
</p>
<p>
  So does seL4 have zero bugs? Yes, of course, and no, of course not. See the <a
  href="../About/FAQ.html#does-sel4-have-zero-bugs">FAQ entry</a> for that.

  heading='Implications of the Integrity Property'

<div class="theprose">
<p>
  You can get even more out of the seL4 proofs for your system. For instance,
  using the integrity property, you can run large untrusted legacy code bases
  in your system that have no hope of being formally verified, and you can
  still get formal proofs about security aspects of the entire system.
  This is because the integrity property of seL4 guarantees that, if the system
  is set up correctly, the untrusted code cannot adversely affect the behaviour
  of separated trusted code. The page on <a href="../About/how-to-use.html">how
  to use seL4</a> and the <a href="../About/whitepaper.html">seL4 white paper</a>
  have more examples on this general idea.
</p>
<p>
  This is an incredibly powerful technique. Together with the principle of least
  privilege and the fine-grained capability system of seL4, you can build
  defence in depth into the architecture of your system to a degree that is hard
  to imagine with traditional operating systems. If done right, bugs in one part
  of the systems will be extremely hard or impossible to exploit in any other
  part of the system. A buffer overflow bug in the audio driver? Not a worry for
  safety or security. Maybe the sound will not work, but your critical
  components will. This is in stark contrast to privilege escalation scenarios
  that can happen in a monolithic OS, where some hapless application or library
  can make the entire system vulnerable to a remote network exploit.
</p>
<p>
  Internalising this technique will lead you to build systems with clear
  protection boundaries, least privilege, and clearly defined communication
  channels. That alone already makes systems more robust and easier to analyse
  and understand.
</p>
<p>
  You do not need to perform formal verification of your system or any additional
  code to profit from this property. You can use any other analysis technique
  to make informal arguments about the behaviour of the system and informally
  make use of the integrity isolation provided by seL4 to connect them. This will
  still give you more strength than with any other operating system.
