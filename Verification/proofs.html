<div class="theprose">
<p>
  The seL4 proofs span the following top-level properties.
</p>

<div class="mx-auto w-4/5 pl-2 aspect-2/1">
{% svg images/tries-shutterstock/proof-stack.drawio.svg width="100%" %}
</div>

<ul class="mt-10 space-y-8 text-light">
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      bold="Functional correctness:"
      text="the C code of all verified
      configurations of seL4 behaves precisely as specified in the seL4
      specification and nothing more.
      This is the strongest assurance that the code will not have any
      unspecified behaviour."
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      bold="Binary correctness:"
      text="in the configurations that support this property, the binary machine
      code running on the processor correctly implements the behaviour of the C code assumed
      in the functional correctness proof. By extension, this means the binary code
      implements precisely the behaviour of the specification, and nothing more."
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      bold="Security:"
      text="
      in the configurations that support this property, the specification, and
      by extension the kernel code, prevents an application running on top of seL4
      from modifying data without authorisation (integrity), from interfering
      with resource access of other applications (availability), and from
      learning information from other applications without explicit authorisation
      (confidentiality). Together these security properties enforce the
      <strong>isolation</strong> of components running on top of the kernel,
      allowing critical components to securely run alongside untrusted
      software."
  %}
  {% include green-tick-li.html
      bold="System initialisation:"
      text="
      the proofs above show that seL4 provides strong security &mdash; when used
      correctly. The correct use, in other words how the system must be set up to
      ensure that the properties above hold, is described in the security theorems statements.
      For instance, integrity holds if isolated components
      are not given write access to each other, and confidentiality holds
      between security domains of seL4's domain scheduler, not between arbitrary
      threads. In the configurations that support verified system
      initialisation, the seL4 proof stack has further parts that support the
      task of setting up systems correctly: the <em>capDL</em> specification
      language that lets developers describe access control configurations
      statically, and the user-level <em>system initialiser</em> that takes
      those descriptions, and automatically configures the system to provably conform to
      them at boot time."
  %}
</ul>

<p>
  Note that not all properties are available on all platforms and all
  configurations. See the list of
  <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/sel4/verified-configurations.html">verified
  configurations</a> for the current status of what is available.
</p>
<p>
  The properties listed above are what the proofs show directly. A side effect
  of the strength of these statements is that they also imply that <strong>seL4
  is free from whole classes of common programming errors such as buffer
  overflows, null pointer dereferences, memory leaks, arithmetic exceptions or
  undefined behaviour</strong>. See the page on <a
  href="implications.html">proof implications</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
  As with all proofs, there are still <a href="assumptions.html">assumptions</a>
  that must be met, and there may still be user expectations on kernel behaviour
  that are not captured by the properties proved so far. Nevertheless, this
  degree of strong evidence for security and correct functionality has never
  been achieved before for an OS kernel and is still unrivalled.

  heading='How Strong are the Proofs?'
  id='strength'
%}

<div class="theprose">

<p>
  So how strong are these proofs, really? We can talk about logic, prover
  correctness, and assumptions all day long, but that is all cerebral and
  abstract. Is there nothing more concrete? Can we measure how strong they are?
</p>
<p>
  It turns out that we can. Before we turn to seL4
  itself, there is a <a
  href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/pldi11-preprint.pdf">research
  paper</a> about <em>Finding and Understanding Bugs in C Compilers</em> that
  makes empirical observations about the CompCert C compiler. Like seL4,
  CompCert also comes with a functional correctness proof, and this is what the
  authors find:
</p>

<blockquote>
    The striking thing about our CompCert results is that the middle-end
    bugs we found in all other compilers are absent. As of early 2011,
    the under-development version of CompCert is the only compiler we
    have tested for which Csmith cannot find wrong-code errors. This is
    not for lack of trying: we have devoted about six CPU-years to the
    task.
</blockquote>


<p>
  Now turning towards seL4, there are test suites in addition to the
  formal verification:  one for <a
  href="https://github.com/seL4/sel4bench/">performance tests</a>
  and one for <a href="https://github.com/seL4/sel4test">functional tests</a>.
</p>
<p>Why have these if there is formal verification? There are multiple classes
  that are still interesting to test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Code in the verified kernel that is left as
    an <a href="assumptions.html">assumption</a>, e.g. machine interfaces such
    as caching. These can be tested and has a fairly high density of tests.
  </li>

  <li>
    Code in unverified configurations of the kernel â€” things that are either not yet
    verified or are only for debugging or are for platforms/configuration
    combinations that are unverified.
  </li>

  <li>
    Tests for verified code to confirm expectations: this is testing the
    specification. It is less about coverage, more about usability and
    confirming that the API is what the developers were intending, as opposed to
    what the specification says or what is implemented. It is also helpful when
    such tests break when people make changes to the code before we attempt to
    verify the changes.
  </li>

  <li>
    Tests for verified code that target non-timing/scheduling properties. These
    properties are not covered by the verification, and are not necessarily just for
    performance. Some of these could in theory be verified in further work.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition to the test suites, there are also integration tests with various
  user-level libraries and frameworks to make sure that they still work (or are
  updated appropriately) when we make a change to the kernel API.
</p>

<p>
  This means there are a lot of tests that run frequently, hundreds for every
  code change. seL4 also has been in continued deployment for over a decade.
  This gives us some data.
</p>

<p>
  In all this time, <strong>there have been no functional correctness defects in
  verified code since the functional correctness proof completed in 2009</strong>
  &mdash; more than 15 years of tests, use, and deployment. There have also
  never been any integrity defects in verified code since the integrity proofs
  finished, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  To contrast how remarkable 0 defects in 15 years are: there are defects
  regularly discovered (although at a <em>much lower</em> density than normal
  software) in all areas of seL4 code that are not verified. This is the case
  for unverified configurations of the kernel (e.g. multicore SMP, or x64 VT-x
  virtualisation extensions), including mature ones.  Even in verified
  configurations, every class of unverified code in the kernel has had defects
  in that time: hardware assumptions, compiler assumptions, unverified boot
  code. But not a single one in verified code in 15 years, which is a long time
  for software. This is not surprising, we have a proof for that after all, but
  how remarkable that is can sometimes be hard to grasp.
