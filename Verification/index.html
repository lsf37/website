<p>
   seL4 is the most highly-assured operating system kernel. Its uniqueness
   lies in the formal mathematical proof that it behaves precisely as
   specified and enforces strong security boundaries for applications. This
   makes seL4 the trustworthy foundation of choice for safely running critical
   applications alongside untrusted workloads.
