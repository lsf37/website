  <p>
    <em>Verification</em> aims at building <em>assurance</em> that a system
    meets its intended behaviour, and <em>formal</em> verification provides the
    highest level of such assurance. <em>Certification</em>, on the other hand, is a
    process to assess a system against a pre-existing standard, with
    verification typically being a key component, among other requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Certifying an seL4-based product in critical sectors such as automotive,
    aerospace, critical infrastructure, or defence, where seL4 is
    being <a href="../use.html">used</a>, requires addressing a number of
    requirements. When it comes to the verification of correctness and security,
    seL4's freely available <a href="{% link Verification/proofs.html%}">formal
    proofs</a> provide the highest possible assurance level, going beyond the
    most stringent levels of existing certification schemes.

    <p>
      The international standard known as Common Criteria focuses on computer
      security certification. Its highest Evaluation Assurance Level, EAL 7,
      mandates a certain degree of formal modelling and verification. The formal
      specifications and proofs provided by seL4 go beyond what is required at
      this highest level.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, Common Criteria&apos;s EAL 7 requires a formal model of the security
      policy, functional specification and design specification, with formal
      correspondence between each. From the design specification, it only
      requires an informal mapping to the implementation. In contrast, seL4
      provides a formal proof all the way down to the implementation, and even
      further, to the binary.

    <p>
      Formal methods are required in Common Criteria&apos;s assurance
      class for product <em>development</em> (the standard contains 5 other
      assurance classes, such as tests, life-cycle support, and vulnerability
      assessment). As shown in the figure below, summarising the requirements
      for the development class per EAL, the use of formal modelling and
      verification is only required from EAL 6, and only down to the design
      specification level.

    <p>
      Using seL4 in a certification based on Common Criteria or in a similar
      high-grade security evaluation does not automatically solve all security
      objectives, but does give a large boost to satisfying the development
      requirements.

    <p>
      In the Automotive sector, while not mandatory, the ISO26262 standard for
      functional safety of road vehicles is in widespread use. It defines safety
      integrity levels. To achieve the highest safety integrity levels, ISO26262
      recommends the use of formal methods throughout the development lifecycle.
      The strength of seL4's formal proofs is considerably higher than what
      ISO26262's highest level, ASIL-D, requires.
    </p>
    <p>
      In more detail, ISO26262 defines an automotive-specific risk-based approach that
      determines risk classes as four Automotive Safety Integrity Levels
      (ASILs), depending on risk severity, likely exposure and
      controllability. The highest level, ASIL-D, corresponds to events having
      reasonable possibility of causing a life-threatening or fatal injury, with
      the injury being physically possible in most operating conditions, and
      with little chance the driver can do anything to prevent the injury.
    </p>
    <div class="w-full my-6 lg:my-8 mx-auto aspect-2/1">
      {% svg /images/tries-shutterstock/certif-iso-asil.drawio.svg width="100%" %}
    </div>
    <p>
      In ISO26262, formal verification is recommended for
      ASIL-C and ASIL-D risk classes. Note that in this standard, <em>formal
      verification</em> is defined as a method used to prove the correctness of
      a system against the specification in formal notation of its required
      behaviour. In other words, only the specification is mandated to be
      formal, and any analysis (including testing) with respect to such a formal
      specification fulfils the ISO26262 recommendation for formal
      verification.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      With its mathematical, machine-checked proofs of correctness and security,
      seL4's assurance level is considerably stronger than ISO26262 highest risk
      recommendations.

  <p>
    DO-178C defines a number of safety objectives to be satisfied by commercial
    software-based aerospace systems, depending on the effects their failure may
    have on the aircraft, crew, and passengers. At the highest assurance level,
    called Level A software, objectives related to software development include
    evidence about the system's high-level and low-level requirements (accuracy,
    verifiability, traceability, compliance etc) as well as its architecture and
    partitioning. The seL4 proofs of correctness and security provide such
    evidence with the strength of mathematical proofs.
  </p>
  <p>
    DO-178C defines five assurance levels, depending on the effects of
    failures, ranging from <em>Level A software</em>, when failures may
    have <em>catastrophic</em> effects that may cause deaths, usually with loss
    of the aircraft, to <em>Level E software</em>, when failures have <em>no
    safety effect</em>. For instance, Level A has 71 objectives to satisfy
    whereas Level E has none. The table below shows some of the objectives
    related to the software development process, showing that the most stringent
    software levels require a number of objectives in terms of accuracy,
    verifiability, traceability and compliance of the high-level and low-level
    requirements.

  <p>
    For this aerospace standard, there also exists a guide specifically for
    the use of Formal Methods: the DO-333 Formal Methods Supplement. The
    supplement identifies the modifications and additions to DO-178C objectives,
    activities, and software life cycle data that should be addressed when
    formal methods are used as part of the software development process. It
    includes requirements for the use of formal notations with unambiguous,
    mathematically defined syntax and semantics, soundness of the formal
    analysis methods used, and justification of all assumptions used in each
    formal analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    The seL4 proofs use the <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de">Isabelle/HOL
    theorem prover</a>, with all
    <a href="{%link Verification/assumptions.html%}">assumptions explicitly stated</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    DO-178C also refers to another supplement, DO-330, for the qualification of
    verification tools used in the certification. It specifies five tool
    qualification levels (TQL) depending on three criteria: whether (1) the tool
    output is part of the airborne software and thus could insert an error; (2)
    the tool automates a verification process <em>and</em>
    is used to justify the elimination or reduction of other verification
    processes; or whether the tools is just used to automate a verification
    process. Each of TQL-1 to TQL-5 defines a list of objectives to
    fulfil. For instance, objectives related to the source code of the tool are
    not required for TQL-4 or TQL-5, i.e., for tools that do not generate code
    that becomes part of the airborne software.
  </p>

    {% svg /images/tries-shutterstock/certif-do330-tql.drawio.svg width="100%" %}
  </div>
  <p>
    For seL4, there is no code generated from Isabelle/HOL that results in the
    seL4 code base. So criterion 1 does not apply. Moreover Isabelle's logic is
    based on a well-known, small core set of axioms that have been validated in
    the literature, with all extensions derived from first principles. No
    external tool is trusted: all outputs from external tools go through the
    creation of a corresponding proof within Isabelle's proof kernel. Axioms and
    assumptions of a formalisation can be tracked. While to our knowledge
    Isabelle/HOL has not been qualified yet for a DO-178C certification, it
    should be well able to meet DO-330 requirements.
