    seL4 formal proofs provide extremely strong assurance that it functions
    correctly and enforces critical security properties. Such evidence are
    commonly required by certification authorities to approve the use of
    computer systems in critical sectors, such as <a href="#CC">Common
    Criteria</a> for security products, <a href="#ISO26262">ISO 26262</a> in the
    automotive sector, <a href="#DO178C">DO-178C</a> in the avionic

  <p>
    <em>Verification</em> aims at building <em>assurance</em> that a system
    meets its intended behaviour, and <em>formal</em> verification provides the
    highest level of such assurance. <em>Certification</em>, on the other hand, is a
    process to assess a system against a pre-existing standard, with
    verification typically being a key component, among other requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Certifying an seL4-based product in critical sectors such as automotive,
    aeropsace, critical infrastructure, or defense, where seL4 is
    being <a href="../About/use.html">used</a>, requires addressing a number of
    requirements. When it comes to the verification of correctness and security,
    the seL4's open-source, formal proofs provide the highest possible assurance
    level, beyond the most striggent levels of existing certification schemes.

    <p>
      The international standard known as Common Criteria focuses on computer
      security certification. Its highest Evaluation Assurance Level, EAL 7,
      mandates a certain degree of formal modelling and verification. The formal
      specifications and proofs provided by seL4 go beyond what is required at
      this highest level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Namely, Common Criteria&apos;s EAL 7 requires a formal model of the security
      policy, functional specification and design specification, with formal
      correspondance between each. From the design specification, it only
      requires an informal mapping to the implementation. In contrast, seL4
      provides a formal proof all the way down to the implementation, and even
      further to the binary.

    </p>
    <p>
      More precisely, formal methods are required in Common Criteria&apos;s assurance
      class for product <em>development</em> (the standard contains 5 other
      assurance classes, such as tests, life-cycle support, or vulnerability
      assessment). As shown in the figure below, summarising the requirements
      for the developement class per EAL, the use of formal modelling and
      verification is only required from EAL 6, and only down to the design
      specification level.

    <p>
      In the Automotive sector, while not mandatory, the ISO26262 standard for
      functional safety of road vehicles is highly used. To achieve the highest
      safety integrity levels, ISO26262 recommends the use of formal methods
      throughout the development lifecycle. The strength of seL4 formal proofs
      is much higher than what is required by ASIL-D, ISO26262's highest level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Namely, ISO26262 defines an automotive-specific risk-based approach that
      determines risk classes as four Automotive Safety Integrity Levels
      (ASILs), depending on the risk severity, likely exposure and
      controllability. The highest level, ASIL-D, corresponds to events having
      reasonable possibility of causing a life-threatening or fatal injury, with
      the injury being physically possible in most operating conditions, and
      with little chance the driver can do something to prevent the injury.
      <div class="w-full md:w-9/10 lg:w-5/6 my-6 mx-auto aspect-2/1">
	{% svg /images/tries-shutterstock/certif-iso-asil.drawio.svg width="100%" %}
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      In ISO26262, formal verification is recommended (not <em>highly</em>) for
      ASIL-C and ASIL-D risk classes. Note that in this standard, <em>formal
      verification</em> is defined as a method used to prove the correctness of
      a system against the specification in formal notation of its required
      behaviour. In other words, only the specification is mandated to be
      formal, and any analysis (including testing) with respect to such a formal
      specification is fulfilling the ISO26262 recommendation for formal
      verification. With its mathematical, machine-checked proofs of correctness
      and security, seL4's assurance level is much stronger than ISO26262
      highest risk recommendations.

  <p>
    DO-178C defines a number of safety objectives to be satisfied by commercial
    software-based aerospace systems, depending on the effects their failure may
    have on the aircraft, crew, and passengers. At the highest assurance level,
    called Level A software, objectives related to software development include
    evidence about the system's high-level and low-level requirements (accuracy,
    verifiability, traceability, compliance etc) as well as its architecture and
    partitioning. The seL4 proofs of correctness and security provide such
    evidences with the strength of mathematical proofs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Namely, DO-178C defines five assurance levels, depending on the effects of
    failures, ranging from <em>Level A software</em>, when failures may
    have <em>catastrophic</em> effects that may cause deaths, usually with loss
    of the aircraft, to <em>Level E software</em>, when failures have <em>no
    safety effect</em>. For instance, Level A has 71 objectives to satisfy
    whereas Level E has none. The table below shows some of the objectives
    related to software development process, showing that the most stringent
    software levels require a number of objectives in terms of accuracy,
    verifiability, traceability and compliance of the high-level and low-level
    requirements.

  <p>
    For this aerospace standard, a guide is also published specifically to
    address the use of Formal Methods: the DO-333 Formal Methods Supplement. The
    supplement identifies the modifications and additions to DO-178C objectives,
    activities, and software life cycle data that should be addressed when
    formal methods are used as part of the software development process. It
    includes requirements for the use of formal notations with unambiguous,
    mathematically defined syntax and semantics, soundness of the formal
    analysis methods used, and justification of all assumptions used in each
    formal analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of the seL4 proofs, they are using the Isabelle theorem prover,
    with all the assumptions being explicitely stated.
  </p>
  <!-- FIXME: say more...-->
  <!-- FIXME: link to Isabelle website?-->
  <p>
    DO-178C also refers to DO-330 for the qualification of any tool used, and
    specifies five tool qualification levels (TQL) depending on three criteria:
    whether (1) the tool output is part of the airborne software and thus could
    insert an error; (2) the tool automates a verification process <em>and</em>
    is used to justify the elimination or reduction of other verification
    processes; or the tools is just used to automated a verification
    process. Then each of TQl-1 to TQL-5 defines a list of objectives to
    fulfill. For instance, objectives related to the source code of the tool is
    not required for TQL-4 or TQL-5, i.e., for tools not generating code that is
    part of the airborne software.
    <div class="w-4/5 md:w-3/4 lg:w-2/3 my-6 mx-auto aspect-2/1">
      {% svg /images/tries-shutterstock/certif-do330-tql.drawio.svg width="100%" %}
    </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the case of the use of the Isabelle theorem prover in seL4, there is no
    code generated from Isabelle that results in the seL4 code base. So criteria
    1 does not apply. Moreover Isabelle's logic is based on a very small core
    set of axioms, that have been manually validated, with all extensions
    derived from first principles. No external tool is trusted: all outputs from
    external tools go through the creation of a corresponding proof within
    Isabelle.
