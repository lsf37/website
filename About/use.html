      seL4's formally verified isolation enforcement enables a unique solution
      for safely running critical applications alongside any uncritical
      workloads. This capability has a significant impact across critical
      sectors such as automotive, aerospace, infrastructure, defense, secure
      communications, and more. Here are some examples of where seL4 is being
      used. There are many more: seL4 is open source and many products or
      development are not or cannot be public. If you would like

  well-resourced attackers. Atoll will leverage the seL4 microkernel, configured
  as a multikernel, to provide verified isolation between virtualized workloads
  running on datacenter-class hardware with hundreds of CPU cores. This approach
  will deliver orders-of-magnitude increases in hardware performance while
  retaining the benefits of formal verification.

  description='

  In the DARPA-funded HACMS program, seL4 was embedded in a range of autonomous
  vehicles, ranging from trucks, a land robot, and a quadcopter to Boeing&apos;s
  Unmanned Little Bird helicopter. At the end-of-project demonstration, the
  HACMS Red Team — a professional team of hackers — was unsuccessful at
  compromising the security of the helicopter, in flight: they were given full
  access to the uncritical camera feed, and were even given the keys to crash
  its virtual machine, but seL4 prevented the cyber attack from compromising the
  flight mission.
