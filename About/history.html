    The seL4 story began in the early 2000s. In 2009, the first formally
    verified OS kernel was a scientific breakthrough. Since then, seL4 has
    continued to reach new milestones, both
    in <a href="../Research/publications.html">research</a> and
     <a href="use.html">real-world deployment and use</a>. Here is a walk down
     seL4&apos;s memory lane.

      title="First microkernel: minimality but bad performance"
      description='
      <p>
        The notion of a microkernel first emerged in the 70&apos;s. At that
        time, Operating Systems largely ran in privilege mode (known as kernel
        mode) to provide hardware abstraction mechanisms and services. First
        defined in Brinch Hansen&apos;s Nucleus, then in CMU&apos;s MACH kernel,
        the philosophy behind microkernels is to reduce the kernel (code running
        in kernel mode) to a minimal core that is free from policy, while the
        rest of the operating system services run in unprivileged mode (known as
        application mode).
      </p>
      <p>
        The achilles&apos; heel of microkernels at the time was performance:
        applications code would obtain system services by communicating via an
        interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism, making IPC on the critical
        path of any service invocation. This led to poor performance, claimed by
        some to be intrinsic to microkernels design.

      description='
      <p>
        In 1993 Jochen Liedtke demonstrated with his L4 kernel that microkernel
        IPC could be fast, a factor 10â€“20 faster than contemporary
        microkernels. This remarkable order-of-magnitude performance improvement
        was the start of a journey that created a whole family of microkernels
        and led to large-scale commercial deployment. Read more on L4

      description='

      <p>
        In 2004, after spending some years experimenting with microkernel
        designs looking for performance and complexity reduction opportunities,
        Gernot Heiser and Kevin Elphinstone partnered with Gerwin Klein with the
        project to target assurance without compromising on performance:
        producing a formally verified microkernel (of the L4 family) at no more
        than 10% performance degradation. The L4.verified project started. Kevin
        led the design of a new kernel of the L4 family which would be
        verifiable, while Gerwin led the formal specification and verification
        of it. seL4 was born.

      <p>
	On July 29, 2009, the last "sorry" of the seL4 functional correctness
	proof was eliminated. A "sorry" is an assumed theorem lacking a complete
	proof. In this pioneer field of proof engineering, where measuring
	progress was unchartered territory, counting these "sorries" was one,
	albeit imperfect, way to monitor progression: hundreds of theorems were
	first stated and "sorried" so work on their proofs could be parallelised
	and tracked. Being imperfect, the measure would go up from time to time,
	for instance when new properties to be proven were discovered. Combined
	with the intrinsic all-or-nothing nature of formal proofs, the
	project&apos;s completion estimate was "2-to-4 weeks" for a very long
	time. When this last sorry was finally proved, which we now celebrate
	every year as the seL4 day, the world had its first formally verified
	kernel.

      description='
      <p>
        The impact of seL4&apos;s verification has been clearly significant in the
	<a href="../Research/">Research</a> area, with high-impact
	<a href="../Research/publications.html">publications</a> spanning the
	disciplines of Systems and Formal Methods. Its lasting real-world
	significance though began with the
	DARPA-funded <a href="http://loonwerks.com/projects/hacms.html">HACMS
	program</a>, where seL4 was embedded in a range of autonomous vehicles,
	ranging from trucks, a land robot, a quadcopter, and Boeing&apos;s
	Unmanned Little Bird (ULB) helicopter. At the end-of-project
	demonstration, the HACMS Red Team -- a professional team of hackers --
	unsuccessfully tried to compromise the security of the
	ULB, <span class="italic">in flight</span>: they were given access to
	the uncritical camera feed, and could crash that, but seL4 prevented the
	cyber attack from compromising the flight mission. This sent a
	resounding message, recognised by numerous
	<a href="../Research/awards.html">awards</a>, in DARPA and beyond, that
	formally verified software does provide unprecedented assurance and can
	be retrofitted to protect highly critical real-world systems.
      </p>
      <p>
	HACMS was also the project where seL4 started to be ported to new
	architectures and platforms. The original proof stack only held for Arm
	32-bit hardware. During the project the proof was ported to Intel x64
	architecture. This was the start of a continuing widening of the scope
	of <a href="TODO">all supported architectures and platforms that seL4
	now supports.</a>
