    The seL4 story began in the early 2000s. In 2009, the first formally
    verified OS kernel was a scientific breakthrough. Since then, seL4 has
    continued to reach new milestones, both
    in <a href="../Research/publications.html">research</a> and
     <a href="use.html">real-world deployment and use</a>. Here is a walk down
     memory lane with seL4.

<p>
  The notion of a microkernel first emerges in the 70&apos;s. At that
  time, operating systems largely ran in privileged mode, also known as kernel
  mode, to provide hardware abstraction mechanisms and services. First
  defined in Brinch Hansen&apos;s Nucleus, then in CMU&apos;s MACH kernel,
  the philosophy behind microkernels is to reduce the code running
  in kernel mode to a minimal core that is free from policy, while the
  rest of the operating system services run in unprivileged mode,
  just like application code.
</p>
<p>
  The Achilles&apos; heel of microkernels at the time was performance:
  application code would obtain system services by communicating via an
  interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism, putting this IPC on the
  critical path of any service invocation. This led to poor performance,
  claimed by some to be intrinsic to microkernels design.

      <p>
        In 1993, Jochen Liedtke demonstrates with his L4 kernel that microkernel
        IPC can be fast, a factor 10-20 faster than contemporary
        microkernels. This remarkable order-of-magnitude performance improvement
        is the start of a journey that will create a whole family of microkernels
        and lead to large-scale commercial deployment. Read more on L4

      <p>
        In 2004, combining experience in microkernel design with expertise in
        formal verification, Gernot Heiser and Kevin Elphinstone partner with
        Gerwin Klein in a project that targets highest assurance without
        compromising on performance: producing a formally verified microkernel
        (of the L4 family) at no more than 10% performance degradation. The
        L4.verified project starts. Kevin is leading the design of a new kernel
        of the L4 family which would be verifiable, while Gerwin is leading the
        formal specification and verification of it. seL4 is born. It not only
        meets its performance goal, but ends up being even faster than other L4
        kernels.

	On July 29, 2009, the last "sorry" of the seL4 functional correctness proof is
	eliminated. A "sorry" is an assumed theorem lacking a complete proof. In the
	emerging field of proof engineering measuring progress was uncharted territory
	&mdash; counting these "sorries" is one, albeit imperfect, way to monitor
	progress: hundreds of theorems were first stated and "sorried" so work on
	their proofs could be parallelised and tracked. Being imperfect, the measure
	can go up during steady progress, for instance when new properties are
	discovered that need to be proved. "0 sorries" means there is nothing left to
	prove: the project is finished. We now celebrate this day every year to mark
	the seL4 day, when the world&apos;s first formally verified kernel with a
	machine-checked code-level proof came into existence.

	Functional correctness shows that the seL4 C code behaves exactly as its
	specification mandates. Subsequent breakthroughs demonstrate that
	seL4 enforces the security properties of integrity, confidentiality and
	authority confinement; that the binary code of seL4 has the same
	behaviour as its C implementation; <a href="../Verification/">and
	more</a>. Collectively, this proof stack provides unprecedented assurance
	that applications running on seL4 can be strongly isolated, preventing
	attacks from untrusted applications from propagating to critical ones.

      <p>
        In the research area, the impact of seL4&apos;s verification is immediately
        apparent with high-impact
	<a href="../Research/publications.html">publications</a> spanning the
	disciplines of Systems, Formal Methods, and Software Engineering. For
  lasting real-word significance, it is the
	DARPA-funded <a href="http://loonwerks.com/projects/hacms.html">HACMS
	program</a> that demonstrates and embeds seL4 in a range of autonomous vehicles,
	ranging from trucks, a land robot, and a quadcopter, to Boeing&apos;s
	Unmanned Little Bird helicopter. At the end-of-project
	demonstration, the HACMS Red Team &mdash; a professional team of hackers &mdash;
	is unsuccessful at compromising the security of the
	helicopter, <em>in flight</em>: they were given full access
	to the uncritical camera feed, and were even given the keys to crash its
	virtual machine, but seL4 prevents the cyber attack from compromising the
	flight mission. This sends a resounding message, in DARPA and beyond, not only
	that formally verified software is usable in practice and provides
	unprecedented assurance, but that it can be retrofitted into existing systems
	to protect highly critical real-world systems. Today, the ground-breaking research
	around seL4 is recognised by numerous <a href="../Research/awards.html">awards</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The HACMS program also marks the beginning of porting seL4 to new
        architectures and platforms.
        The original proof stack only held for Arm 32-bit hardware. During the
        project the proof was ported to the Intel x64 architecture. This is the
        start of a continuing widening of the scope of <a
        href="../todo.html">all supported architectures and platforms that seL4
        now supports.</a>
