    The seL4 story began in the early 2000s. In 2009, the first formally
    verified OS kernel was a scientific breakthrough. Since then, seL4 has
    continued to reach new milestones, both
    in <a href="../Research/publications.html">research</a> and
     <a href="use.html">real-world deployment and use</a>. Here is a walk down
     seL4&apos;s memory lane.

      title="First microkernel: minimality but bad performance"
      description='

        The notion of a microkernel first emerged in the 70&apos;s. At that
        time, Operating Systems largely ran in privilege mode (known as kernel
        mode) to provide hardware abstraction mechanisms and services. First
        defined in Brinch Hansen&apos;s Nucleus, then in CMU&apos;s MACH kernel,
        the philosophy behind microkernels is to reduce the kernel (code running
        in kernel mode) to a minimal core that is free from policy, while the
        rest of the operating system services run in unprivileged mode (known as
        application mode).

        The achilles&apos; heel of microkernels at the time was performance:
        applications code would obtain system services by communicating via an
        interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism, making IPC on the critical
        path of any service invocation. This led to poor performance, claimed by
        some to be intrinsic to microkernels design.

      description='


        In 1993 Jochen Liedtke demonstrated with his L4 kernel that microkernel
        IPC could be fast, a factor 10â€“20 faster than contemporary
        microkernels. This remarkable order-of-magnitude performance improvement
        was the start of a journey that created a whole family of microkernels
        and led to large-scale commercial deployment. Read more on L4

      title="Start of the L4.verified project"
	description='

        In 2004, after spending some years experimenting with microkernel
        designs looking for performance and complexity reduction opportunities,
        Gernot Heiser and Kevin Elphinstone partnered with Gerwin Klein with the
        project to target assurance without compromising on performance:
        producing a formally verified microkernel (of the L4 family) at no more
        than 10% performance degradation. The L4.verified project started. Kevin
        led the design of a new kernel of the L4 family which would be
        verifiable, while Gerwin led the formal specification and verification
        of it. seL4 was born.
