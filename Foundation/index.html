        The seL4 Foundation provides long-term, independent support for the seL4
        kernel and the seL4 ecosystem, by enabling the collaborative
        community-based development, availability and adoption of the seL4
        kernel. The seL4 Foundation aims to represent the perspectives of all
        main actors in the seL4 community (kernel developers, kernel verifiers,
        ecosystem developers and adopters), in the technical and general
        governance of the seL4 kernel and the&nbsp;seL4 Foundation.

        the evolution and verification of the seL4 kernel, and by supporting the

        development of seL4-based systems.
