    The Trustworthy Systems (TS) team is the creator of seL4 and the seL4
    Foundation, and for a long time was the sole source of support. With the
    seL4 Foundation now in place, and at its new home at UNSW, TS is now
    focusing on seL4-related research and driving development, leaving
    engineering mostly to other ecosystem players. However, TS is happy to take
    on research and consultancy contracts, as well as providing engineering
    (systems and verification) services when no commercial player is available.

  <p>
    Formal verification is what makes seL4 unique. With increasing uptake and
    adoption, seL4 is evolving, supporting more platforms, architectures,
    configurations, and features. An increasing number of high assurance systems
    are built with seL4 as a trustworthy foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
    As seL4 code evolves, so must its formal proofs. As more systems are built
    on seL4, there is an increased need to ensure correct configuration and
    initialisation, and correctness of critical components.
  </p>
  <p>
    Proofcraft is here to help. Founded by the seL4 verification leaders, it
    offers commercial support, verification projects, training and consulting on
    formal verification in general, and involving seL4 specifically.
  </p>
  <p>
    By applying mathematical machine-checked software verification, Proofcraft
    increases critical software systems&apos; reliability, safety and security, for a
    verified future.
