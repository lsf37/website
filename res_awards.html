  	<p>
			The formal verification of seL4 was a breakthrough in both the Systems
			and the Formal Methods research disciplines. Applying the rigor of a
			mathematical computer-checked proof to a high-performance, deployable
			was a world first. It has since been followed by increasingly stronger
			assurance, as well as demonstrations of prevention of cyber-attacks on
			systems in operation. This has been recognised by international
			acclaimed awards.

	  real-world products, such as unmanned air and ground vehicles, to
	  provide unprecedented protection against cyber attacks.
