  After getting a solid seL4 background you can move on to building
  seL4-based systems. Next steps include working on one of
  our <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/SuggestedProjects.html">suggested
  projects</a> or helping to expand
  the <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/available-user-components.html">collection
  of libraries and components</a> available to build seL4-based
  systems.
