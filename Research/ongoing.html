    The seL4 ecosystem includes research organizations that are pushing the
    boundaries of what seL4 can achieve and provide. The following is a list
    of research groups working on seL4-related projects. If you would like

    Trustworthy Systems (TS) is a research group at the School of Computer
    Science and Engineering (CSE) of UNSW Sydney. TS uses rigorous formal
    methods to develop trustworthy software systems &mdash; systems that come with
    provable security, safety and reliability guarantees.
  </p>
  <p>
    The current research projects in Trustworthy Systems related to seL4
    include: <em>LionsOS</em>, a secure, fast, adaptable operating system for
    seL4; <em>Time protection</em>, a principled, fundamental approach for the
    systematic prevention of timing channels with seL4; <em>Pancake</em>, a new
    low-level programming language designed specifically for the verification of
    device drivers and other low-level system programs; and much more.

	SAnToS Lab conducts both theoretical and applied research on
	Specification, Analysis, and Transformation of Software.  Its current
	research projects related to seL4 include HAMR (High-Assurance
	Model-based Rapid Engineering of Embedded Systems). HAMR is an
	open-source code generation and system build framework for embedded
	systems whose architecture is specified using the Architecture Analysis
	and Design Language (AADL). It can be used to create deployable builds
	on seL4 and has been used for instance in the DARPA CASE program.

        One of the focus areas of ETH&apos;s Systems Group is on Operating Systems
        Design and Implementation. Their seL4-related research projects include
        discovery and mitigation of timing channels, and generation of trustworthy
        hardware/software drivers for seL4. The group is contributing its hardware
        experience to the time protection project in collaboration with TS at UNSW.
