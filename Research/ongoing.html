    The seL4 ecosystem includes research organizations that are pushing the
    boundaries of what seL4 can achieve and provide. The following is a list
    of research groups working on seL4-related projects. If you would like

    Trustworthy Systems (TS) is a research group in the School of Computer
    Science and Engineering (CSE) at UNSW Sydney. TS works on building highly
    secure operating systems for the real world. Their approach is based on
    highly principled designs that support the use of rigorous formal methods to
    ensure security and reliability without compromising performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, TS&apos;s main activities are: Time protection, a principled,
    fundamental approach for the systematic prevention of timing channels and
    its implementation and verification in seL4; LionsOS, an seL4-based, fast,
    secure and adaptable operating system for embedded and cyber-physical
    systems; Pancake, a new low-level programming language designed to enable
    the implementation and verification of low-level systems code, such as
    device drivers; the design of a provably-secure seL4-based general-purpose
    OS.

	SAnToS Lab conducts both theoretical and applied research on
	Specification, Analysis, and Transformation of Software.  Its current
	research projects related to seL4 include HAMR (High-Assurance
	Model-based Rapid Engineering of Embedded Systems). HAMR is an
	open-source code generation and system build framework for embedded
	systems whose architecture is specified using the Architecture Analysis
	and Design Language (AADL). It can be used to create deployable builds
	on seL4 and has been used for instance in the DARPA CASE program.

        One of the focus areas of ETH&apos;s Systems Group is on Operating Systems
        Design and Implementation. Their seL4-related research projects include
        discovery and mitigation of timing channels, and generation of trustworthy
        hardware/software drivers for seL4. The group is contributing its hardware
        experience to the time protection project in collaboration with TS at UNSW.
