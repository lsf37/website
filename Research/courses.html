  <p>
    University courses that are relevant to the seL4 ecosystem include
    lectures on Operating Systems and lectures on Formal Software
    Verification. The following is a list of such courses. If you would like
    a course to be added to this list, please contact us.

    <h2>Advanced Operating Systems</h2>
    <div></div>
    <div class="feature-text">
      <p>
	The course, offered at UNSW Sydney, Australia, provides students with a
	deep understanding of modern operating system technology, implementation
	techniques and research issues. It develops general “systems skills”,
	the ability to design, implement and understand a complex software
	system. It specifically provides a thorough understanding of low-level
	system software and its interaction with hardware, the trade-offs that
	determine system performance, techniques to assess performance
	correctly, and the impact of system design on security. The course is
	based on seL4 and students build an seL4-based operating system. The
	lectures are
	available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtoQeavghzr3nlXyJEXaTLU9Ca0DXWMnt">online</a>.

    <h2>Advanced Topics in Software Verification</h2>
    <div></div>
    <div class="feature-text">
      <p>
	This course, offered at UNSW Sydney, Australia, is about mechanical
	proof assistants, how they work, and what they can be used for.  It
	presents specification and proof techniques used in industrial grade
	interactive theorem provers, teaches the theoretical background to the
	techniques involved, and shows how to use a theorem prover to conduct
	formal proofs in practice.  Topics include higher order logic, natural
	deduction, lambda calculus, term rewriting, data types and recursive
	functions, induction principles, and proofs about programs. The course
	will provide hands-on experience with the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL,
	which is used in the verification of seL4.

    <div class="feature-text">
      <p>
	This course, offered at ANU, Canberra, Australia is based on the course
	Advanced Topics in Software Verification offered by UNSW. It has the
	same objectives and outcomes, and will provide hands-on experience with
	the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL, which is used in the verification of
	seL4.
