    Verification makes seL4 unique. With increasing adoption, seL4 is evolving to support more platforms, architectures, configurations, and features, meaning its formal proofs must evolve as well. Proofcraft is committed to keep this evolution alive. In this talk, we will present the status of the seL4 verification roadmap.

    seL4â€™s extensive formal verification comprises formal proofs of a number of properties for various hardware architectures: AArch32, Intel x64 and RISC-V (64-bit). These properties include:

    The verification matrix of architectures, properties, configurations and seL4 features is ever evolving. AArch32 still has the most complete proof stack, but RISC-V is catching up. Intel x64 and AArch32 with hypervisor extensions have verified functional correctness. The current roadmap includes completion of the seL4 MCS configuration (support for mixed-criticality systems), functional correctness of seL4 on AArch64, and progress on multicore seL4 verification.
