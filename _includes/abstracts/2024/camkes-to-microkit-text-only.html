    This talk presents an experience report on migrating seL4-based systems from the CAmkES VMM to the Microkit VMM. Microkit is a simple framework and SDK created to enable more efficient designs and lower the barrier to entry to seL4.  The presentation will compare and contrast MicroKit with CAmkES and highlight a few reasons to start using Microkit.  In addition, it will examine how MicroKit can make learning and developing seL4-based systems easier and breakdown roadblocks encountered by new users when porting to a new platform. Finally, we will present our gap analysis between the two VMMs and highlight what still needs to be addressed so users can start developing real-world products.
