    Assured Reserve Modes are a mechanism that weâ€™ve developed for the seL4-based Kry10 OS that allows a system to switch between pre-configured operating modes at runtime in response to security, safety, and other routine operational events. In this presentation we show the operation of assured reserve modes in action.

<p>
    We present the Kry10 OS design and implementation of assured reserve modes, demonstrating their application to a representaive industrial control system (based on the Fischertechnik Training Factory 4.0).  The system is exposed to security and safety incidents, which it will detect and then switch into appropriate reserve modes in order to mitigate, resolve, or contain the problem.

    This presentation is a companion to the Assured Reserve Modes presentation that describes the assured reserve mode model and mechanism itself.
