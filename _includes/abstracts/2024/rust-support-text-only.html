    The development and maintenance of Rust support in seL4 userspace has been an official seL4 Foundation project since last year’s summit. This project’s scope includes libraries for interacting with the seL4 API, higher-level libraries for use in seL4 userspace (e.g. support for asynchronous programming and integration with the seL4 Device Driver Framework), Rust language runtimes for root tasks and Microkit protection domains, modular building blocks for custom seL4 userspace Rust language runtimes, a CapDL system initializer implementation, and an easy-to-use kernel loader. The past year has seen the expansion and refinement of this project’s library offerings, the release of relevant educational materials, and further integration with the rest of the seL4 software ecosystem. In this talk, we will cover progress since last year’s summit, demonstrate how to leverage this work in your own systems, and share our vision and goals for the path ahead.
