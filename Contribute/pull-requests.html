In general, a pull request not should only communicate what the change is,
but more importantly why it is necessary. The guide below helps you to provide
the information that will make it likely that a change will be accepted.

## Creation

Pull requests should be created from personal forks. We follow a [fork-rebase
workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow).

### Title

The title should summarise the set of commits, and indicate *what* the pull
request is about. For a single commit, the title can be subject line of the
commit message.

### Description

- Must state the *why* and the *how* for the change.
  - Usually this is the body of your commit message.
  - Explain the motivation behind the change. Why is it necessary and should be
    accepted? As a brief calibration on what we consider necessary: Fixing bugs
    is necessary. Only cleaning up style is not necessary. Cleaning up code
    that is touched anyway in the pull request is an improvement. Improving performance
    and reducing maintenance cost is generally beneficial, as is improving
    usability, provided it outweighs the cost of making the change. Adding a
    feature may require an [RFC].
  - Do not leave the description field empty, even if you think the change is
    obvious.

- If the pull request is for feedback only, and not ready to merge, set it to "Draft"

- Explain any context:
  - is it part of a greater set of changes?
  - are any concurrent PRs (in other repositories) dependent on this pull request?
  - provide links in the description

- State what testing has been performed. For the kernel, if a new major feature
  has been added, corresponding tests must be added to `sel4test`. Include a
  link to the corresponding `sel4test` pull request in the description. For other
  projects, see their corresponding test suites.

- For the kernel: if the change breaks the formal verification, it must come
  with an update to the proofs (see below). Provide a link to the corresponding
  pull request that updates the verification in the description or state where/how
  verification is being conducted. You can propose changes without verification,
  but they cannot be merged before verification is complete. Reviewers will add
  the label `verification` if a change to the proofs is necessary.


### Commits

- Commit history and messages are part of the review
  - A good commit history assists reviewers in understanding the change
  - Please see the [Git conventions][git].

- Good reviews are small reviews. Large PRs should only be created if absolutely
  necessary and are unlikely to generate excitement from reviewers.

### Requesting Reviewers

You do not need to request specific reviewers, and anyone can help to review a
pull request.

- If you do want a particular person to review, please tag them.
- If there hasn't been any activity after a couple of days, feel free to bump the post.
- Pull requests require at least one approving review for merge,
  and usually should aim for 2 reviews on each non-trivial pull request.

## During Review

Always abide by the [seL4 Code of Conduct][Conduct].

### For Reviewers

- Take into account the context stated by the author.
- Review commits and commit messages as well as code
- Request that the above guide be followed if it is not.
- Provide constructive feedback -- see the resources below.
- Remember to comment on good things.

### For Authors

- Apply changes due to feedback from reviewers as additional commits, and squash
  them once the pull request is ready to merge.
- Please attempt to only push changes to the pull request branch once it is ready for re-review.
- Please communicate any changes you make during the review process.
- Apart from editing history, fixing review feedback, or fixing trivial issues,
  do not push changes to a pull request once it has been approved.

### Tests

The foundation repositories require the following tests to pass before a pull
request can be merged. Exceptions are possible by approval of someone in the
[Committer][Committers] role.

- Code style. Style checks may vary per repository and language, but default
  should standardise on those in the repository
  [seL4/seL4_tools](https://github.com/seL4/seL4_tools/tree/master/misc).
- Developer certificate of origin ([DCO][dco])
- Checks for SPDX license tagging (using the [REUSE tool][reuse])
- Any applicable regression tests

Regression tests vary per repository. For seL4 itself, they must include:

- compile test
- hardware and/or simulator runs. Reviewer can add the `hw-build`,
  `hw-test`, and `hw-bench` labels to run hardware builds and tests
  on pull requests.
- the proofs

For verification target repositories (currently mainly seL4):

- a pull request can only be merged on the master branch if either
  the corresponding proof is updated or if there is no proof impact.
- there is no proof impact if:
  - the preprocessed source for verified code has not changed
    (the "preprocess" check on GitHub succeeds), or
  - the proof still works unchanged despite the code change.
    Reviewers can add the `proof-test` label to run the current proofs
    on a pull request.
- for proof updates:
  - submit a pull request to the [`l4v`](https://github.com/seL4/l4v)
    repository together with the
    pull request for the [`seL4`](https://github.com/seL4/seL4)
    repository, or
  - ping the `@verification` team on the GitHub seL4 org for help in
    updating the proofs, or
  - talk to the [seL4 Foundation][foundation] about finding funding
    and/or volunteers for the proofs updates if it is a bigger project.

## Merging

Anyone in the [Committer][Committers] role can merge pull requests after they
satisfy the required tests and approvals.
